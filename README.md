# Keypad

The Keypad is a 4 key macropad.

It is designed to help users easily edit their text documents, by providing features such as space and ctrl + left/right which will help them move past a whole word instead of just one character.

## Features:
- Case
- 2 WS2812B RGB LEDs
- 3 Keys

## CAD Model:
Everything fits together using 4 M3 Bolts and heatset inserts.

It has 2 separate printed pieces. The base where the PCB sits, and the top cover.
